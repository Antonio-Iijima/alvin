# What is ALVIN?

**A**LVIN is a **L**ISP **v**ariant **i**mplementatio**n**. It is loosely based on the implementation of LISP outlined in Paul Graham's essay *The Roots of LISP*, and developed over the course of CSCI 370: Programming Languages under the tutelage of Dr. Saverio Perugini.

ALVIN retains the major syntactic structures of LISP (most notably parentheses); but not all the same functions and control structures are supported. For example, while ALVIN has a `let`, it does not have a `letrec`. ALVIN literals are indicated by a '__', e.g. `'Example'`.
